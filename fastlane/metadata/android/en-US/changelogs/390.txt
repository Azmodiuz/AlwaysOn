This version features a new way of rendering the always-on display. In addition, you can now view the weather on your always-on display and set a custom background from your gallery. Notification icons are now displayed in multiple rows, so they no longer overflow outside the visible area. Furthermore, you can enable coloring notification icons in their app colors. In addition, you can now configure the double tap speed to your liking and choose what charging types count as charging. A new permission management system has been implemented as well so that permission requests only appear when needed. As another great new feature, there is now an analog clock, and you can display the events of the next 24 hours on your AOD! Last but not least, for people with large displays: You can now adjust the display scale up to 200%. 
This is a beta version and may be unstable.
